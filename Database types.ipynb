    "What is a column family?\n",
    "A column family is a database object that contains columns of data. Each column family stored is made up of a key/value pair, where the key is mapped to a value that is a set of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, each column family might store one or multiple attributes - if we want to represent large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An individual column within a column family will normally contain a name, value, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about this is that each row has a unique identifier - sometimes referred to as a row key - and then the full details of each attribute stored against it as dedicated columns.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Wide column database column family\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we achieve the flexible, dynamic rows that we talked about earlier, as it enables us to store different attributes for individual data entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide-column databases vs RDBMSs\n",
    "So, to solidify our understanding of wide-column databases, let’s think about how they differ from some of the other types of solutions that you’re probably familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big alternative here is traditional relational database management systems (RDBMSs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most relational databases, including SQL variants, are row-orientated. Each row must store the same attributes as columns - even if some of these are null for individual entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal behind these is to ensure both consistency across your data set, and performance when querying multiple columns in a single row - known as online transactional processing (OLTP) use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, they’re less efficient for situations where we need to retrieve large numbers of values for a handful of columns across different rows - making them less effective for big data, IoT, or analytical use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw already, wide-column databases are effectively the mirror image of this, offering superior performance for online analytical processing (OLAP) use cases since we can query entire data sets for a particular attribute, without needing to know about the whole row.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it’s not quite the case that one solution is inherently better than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to the idea of consistency for a second. This is one of the big selling points of RDBMSs. We can consistently enforce rules on attributes across all of our data with relative ease - at the expense of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide-column databases strike a slightly different balance. As we know, part of the appeal is that we can store different attributes against individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naturally undermines the degree of consistency we can achieve across the data set as a whole, compared to something like MySQL or Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide-columns and other NoSQL solutions\n",
    "Wide-column databases - and column-orientated databases more generally fall under the umbrella of NoSQL tools. This is a pretty broad categorization though - essentially drawing in any solution that isn’t a traditional SQL-based RDBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it’s worth surveying the landscape a little bit in order to better understand where wide-column stores fit into the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important clusters of NoSQL solutions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key/value stores - A simple database where all data is stored in key/value pairs.\n",
    "Document databases - A database where entities are represented by documents, usually in a JSON or XML format.\n",
    "Column-orientated databases - Where - as we’ve seen - data is stored in its constituent columns.\n",
    "Graph databases - Where database objects are stored as related nodes.\n",
    "Each of these comes with its own particular benefits and challenges. For example, key/value stores offer a high degree of simplicity and scalability, but make it more difficult to represent complex phenomena and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document stores make it easy to store and retrieve entire objects as they are most often used by client applications, but can make it a little more complicated to perform bulk actions on these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases make it easy to represent complex relationships between entities - as well as facilitating real-time data access - but they can also be quite complex to understand and work with.\n",
    "\n",
